Made two spring boot projects
docker up redis
made route in gateway to reach demo
add API Key enforcement (gateway blocks requests without a valid X-API-Key). This is milestone M1


############### Notes ##############
In production:
API Gateway = policy enforcement layer
Responsibilities:
Authentication
Rate limiting
Logging
Circuit breaking
Routing
Real examples

Spring Cloud Gateway → Netflix, Alibaba, VMware

AWS API Gateway → same concepts (API keys + throttling)

Kong / Traefik / Envoy → same patterns

Kubernetes Ingress + Gateway API → same responsibilities

What changes in prod
Dev	Prod
Keys in YAML	Keys in Redis / DB
Manual restart	Dynamic reload
Few clients	Thousands
Simple logs	Structured + metrics

But the design stays identical.
